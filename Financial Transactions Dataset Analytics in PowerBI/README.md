# Financial Transactions Dataset Analytics in Power BI

Basic interactive dashboard built with Power BI based on publicly available credit card transaction dataset (Kaggle).

The project shows:
- Client distribution by card brand,
- Average credit limits by brand,
- Filtering by card type.

Dataset after basic cleaning in Power Query (removed currency symbols, converted credit_limit column from text to numeric values).  
The dataset covers transactions from 2010 to 2020.

This project is part of my BI learning process.
